# subpixel
basic love2d program to make sub-pixel art, inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlS3FOmKUbE
## Usage
Click on a cell to fill it, the output will be rendered below the main panel
## Roadmap
 - Support for alternative pixel sequences (I dont know if there are any other than RGB but might as well)
 - Proper mouse drag drawing
 - Different brushes
